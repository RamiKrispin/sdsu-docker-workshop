Docker has some learning curve, and the goal of this workshop is to reduce the entry barrier for new learners. No prior knowledge of Docker is needed, but it is recommended to have some familiarity with basic command line tools.\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will:\n\nUnderstand the general applications of Docker, and in particular, the ones for data science\nLearn about the advantages and disadvantages of using Docker\nAble to design, build, and run a container",

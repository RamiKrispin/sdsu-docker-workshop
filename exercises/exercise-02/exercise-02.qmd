In this exercies, we will use the following images:

- Ubuntu: `ubuntu:22.04`
- Python: `python:3.10`
- R: `r-base:4.3.1`


Use the pull command to pull the images:
``` shell
docker pull ubuntu:22.04
docker pull python:3.10
docker pull r-base:4.3.1


## Task 1

Pull and run the Python image and try to import the pandas library:

```python
import pandas as pd
```


## Task 2

Create a Dockerfile with `python:3.10` as your base image and:

- Create a folder named requirements
- Copy the requirements.txt file to the requirements folder
- Use pip3 to install the the python libraries from the requirements.txt file:

```shell
RUN pip3 install -r ./requirements/requirements.txt
```


## Task 3

Let's now repeat Task 2, this time:

- Let's define environment variable named `PYTHON_ENV` and set it to workshop_env
- Use Python venv to create a virtual environment and set its name as `PYTHON_ENV`
- Install the python libraries to the venv using the requirements.txt file
- Expose a bash terminal using the `CMD` command
